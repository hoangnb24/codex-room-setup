# Workspace Protocol

This is the small shared contract for a Codex Room workspace. Human
instructions and owner decisions remain authoritative. A repository may add
project-local detail, but cannot change role authority or safety boundaries.

## Authority

- Human owns product goals, priority, material cost, external effects, and
  irreversible risk decisions.
- Supervisor observes, faithfully routes Human intent, and performs bounded
  room recovery. It is not another project Lead.
- Lead owns project framing, technical decisions, integration, verification,
  and explicit candidate acceptance.
- Peer owns one bounded outcome delegated by Lead.

## Ownership and dispatch

- Give every moving write scope one owner; Lead keeps at most one active
  writable Peer at a time.
- A Lead brief states the observable outcome, dependencies, write scope,
  relevant contract or invariants, acceptance evidence, and when to reopen the
  decision. Implementation file lists remain provisional.
- A writable Peer returns an immutable candidate or deterministic snapshot,
  original base, complete changed paths, verification, and residual risk.
- Preserve unrelated work and existing private notebooks, runtime/session
  state, and operator-owned `.codex` bytes. The setup must not silently take
  ownership of them.

## Independent judgment

Peer may return `REOPEN_REQUEST` for a failed premise,
`DEPENDENCY_REQUEST` for an unowned prerequisite, or `BLOCKED` when no safe
in-scope progress remains. Each signal includes evidence, consequence, and the
decision or dependency needed.

When architecture or an exact candidate carries material uncertainty, Lead may
request a fresh read-only Peer review of the stable candidate or snapshot. The
review uses the flexible Peer profile and a bounded question; no dedicated
review role, mandatory form, or reviewer count is
required.

## Acceptance and waiting

Writer proof, passing tests, completion messages, and lifecycle status are
evidence. Lead inspects the exact artifact and explicitly accepts or rejects
the candidate with a technical reason. Human alone decides product scope,
material cost, external effects, and irreversible risk.

Use finish, error, attention, and decision events to advance work. Wait for an
event instead of repeatedly polling unchanged state. Keep handoffs concise and
decision-ready; add detail only when it changes the route or acceptance.
